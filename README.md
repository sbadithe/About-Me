        <p> I am a second-year college student interested in computer science. In my free time, I like reading literature and history    books.</p>
        <hr /> 
        <p> Here are some of the things that I want to learn in the near future: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> Programming in C++ and C </li>
            <li> Data Structures and Algorithms </li>
            <li> The Linux environment 
                <ul>
                    <li> Specifically, I want to learn to work with both Gentoo and Arch </li>
                </ul>
        <p style="color: green;"> My goals for programming projects are not well-defined enough to merit sharing. However I aim to make multiple quality commits a day for the next three months.</p>
